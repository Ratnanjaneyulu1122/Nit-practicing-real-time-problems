 * array. Management wants to know how many unique product categories are
 * available in the system. Write a Java program to count the number of unique
 * elements in the array. Example Input: int[] categoryIds = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4,
 * 5,3}; Expected Output: 4 unique category IDs found. ->this out put is wrong i
 * guess unique means non repeated right so above example is 3 unique is are
 * found 1,4,5
