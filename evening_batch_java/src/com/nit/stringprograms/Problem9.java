/*
 * Question.2)
Write a java program for finding twisted prime number from integer array element.
for example:int []a={23,31,19,11,113,525,112};
twisted primes are: 31 11 113
twisted prime number means if the reverse of prime number is also prime then that
number is called twisted prime number.
here you have to take two user define method first method will check a number is 
prime or not. and another method for finding reverse of a number.
method like:
1) public static boolean isPrime(int number);
2) public static int reverseNuber(int number);
