 * * Q2. A smartwatch stores the number of steps taken every hour for 10 hours.
 * You are required to calculate the total number of even step counts recorded
 * during odd hours of the day to determine periods of low-intensity activity.
 * 
 * Q3. A scientific calculator has a memory buffer to pre-fill factorials of
 * numbers from 1 to 10 for fast access. Write a program to automatically store
 * factorials from 1 to 10 in an array and display them.
 * 
 * Q4. Two teachers have marked the same set of 5 assignments. Their scores are
 * stored in arrays A and B. You need to generate a final score array C by
 * summing the corresponding scores given by both teachers.
 * 
 * Q5. You are managing two small warehouses. Each warehouse has 5 items
 * recorded in arrays A and B. You want to merge them into a central inventory
 * array C of size 10 such that: First half (0–4): Items from Warehouse A Second
 * half (5–9): Items from Warehouse B
 * 
 * Q6. In a classroom, there are 10 seats. Students from Group A and Group B are
 * to be seated alternately: Odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) → Students from Group
 * A Even positions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) → Students from Group B Store and display
 * the final seating arrangement using array C.
 * 
 * Q7. A sensor records 10 readings per cycle. To reduce storage, we want to
 * compress the data by adding pairs of consecutive readings and store them in a
 * smaller array of size 5. Display the compressed result.
 * 
 * Q8. Two promotional campaigns store the customer IDs who participated. Find
 * the intersection of both campaigns to determine which customers qualified for
 * double rewards. E.g., A = campaign1 customers, B = campaign2 customers, T =
 * qualified customers.
 * 
 * Q9. A user enters 4 numbers and 3 math operations of their choice into a
 * calculator. The calculator should apply the operations sequentially from left
 * to right and display the result. E.g., numbers = [8, 6, 4, 2], operations =
 * ['+', '-', '*'] → (((8 + 6) - 4) * 2)
 * 
 * Q10. A task manager stores up to 10 tasks. Initially, the manager stores 9
 * tasks. When a new task is created, the user should specify at which position
 * they want to insert the new task. Write a program to insert the new task at
 * the desired position and display the final schedule.
 * 
 * Q11. A shopping cart stores 10 items. The user wants to remove an item from a
 * specific position. Write a program to delete the item from that position and
